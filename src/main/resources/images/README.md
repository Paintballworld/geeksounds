# Player Images

Place player profile images here!

## File Naming
Images must be named exactly as the player names in `application.properties`.

For example, if your players are:
```
game.players=Alice,Bob,Charlie
```

Then your images should be named:
- `Alice.jpg` (or .png, .jpeg, .gif, .webp)
- `Bob.png`
- `Charlie.jpg`

## Supported Formats
- JPG/JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)

## Image Recommendations
- Square images work best (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB per image)
- Faces should be clearly visible
- Use consistent style across all player images

## Optional
If an image is not found for a player, the scoreboard will display an icon placeholder instead.
