# Jingle Files

Place your game jingles in the subfolders!

## Folder Structure
- `win/` - Victory/celebration sounds (plays when someone guesses correctly)
- `lose/` - Fail/wrong sounds (plays when a sound is skipped)

## How It Works
The game randomly selects a jingle from the appropriate folder each time, adding variety to the gameplay!

## Tips
- Keep jingles short (2-5 seconds)
- Add 3-5 different sounds in each folder for variety
- Use upbeat, celebratory sounds for win
- Use comedic "fail" sounds for lose
- Make sure volume levels are consistent across all files
