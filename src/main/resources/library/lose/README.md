# Lose Jingles

Place "fail" or "wrong" sound effects here for when sounds are skipped!

## Supported Formats
- MP3 (.mp3)
- WAV (.wav)
- OGG (.ogg)
- M4A (.m4a)

## Examples
- "Wah wah wah" trombone
- Buzzer sounds
- "Wrong!" sound effects
- Comedic fail sounds
- Game show incorrect sounds
- Disappointed crowd sounds

## Tips
- Keep jingles short (2-5 seconds)
- The game will randomly select one from this folder each time a sound is skipped
- Having 3-5 different lose sounds adds variety
- Use lighthearted/funny sounds to keep the game fun
- Make sure volume levels are consistent across all files
